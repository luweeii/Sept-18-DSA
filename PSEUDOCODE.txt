Temperature Converter Pseudocode

START
1. Welcomes the user and asks to enter 1 or to to choose what conversion they want or 3 if they want to exit.
2. User inputs a number to choose
	A. If user inputs 1, system displays Fahrenheit to Celsius converter and asks the user for the fahrenheit value they want to convert.
	- System converts the inputted fahrenheit to celsius with the given formula (temp - 32) * 5/9.
	- Display the converted value from fahrenheit to celsius
	- Go back to the start where system welcomes and asks the user to choose.

	B. If user inputs 2, system displays Celsius to Fahrenheit converter and asks the user for the celsius value they want to convert.
	- System converts the inputted celsius to fahrenheit with the given formula (temp * 9/5) + 32.
	- Display the converted value from celsius to fahrenheit.
	- Go back to the start where system welcomes and asks the user to choose.

	C. If user inputs 3, system displays a thank you message and close the program.

3.  If user inputs any number other than 1, 2, or 3, system displays an error message and asks the user to input the correct choices.

Grading System Pseudocode

START
1. System welcomes the user to the grading system
2. System asks the user to input a student's score
3. User input score
	A. If user inputs a number less than or equal to 59
	- System displays the equivalent grade in Letter Form (F)

	B. If user inputs a number greater than 60 and less than 65
	- System dispalys the equivalent grade in Letter Form (E)

	C. If user inputs a number greater than 66 and less than 71
	- System dispalys the equivalent grade in Letter Form (D)

	D. If user inputs a number greater than 72 and less than 77
	- System dispalys the equivalent grade in Letter Form (C)

	E. If user inputs a number greater than 78 and less than 83
	- System dispalys the equivalent grade in Letter Form (B)

	F. If user inputs a number greater than 84 and less than 89
	- System dispalys the equivalent grade in Letter Form (B+)

	G. If user inputs a number greater than 90 and less than 95
	- System dispalys the equivalent grade in Letter Form (A)

	H. If user inputs a number greater than 96 and less than 100
	- System dispalys the equivalent grade in Letter Form (A+)
4. If user inputs any number above 100, system displays an error message and asks to enter a valid score again.
